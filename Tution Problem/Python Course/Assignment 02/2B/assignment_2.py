#-----Statement of Authorship----------------------------------------#
#
#  This is an individual assessment item for QUT's teaching unit
#  IFB104, "Building IT Systems", Semester 1, 2024.  By submitting
#  this code I agree that it represents my own work.  I am aware of
#  the University rule that a student must not act in a manner
#  which constitutes academic dishonesty as stated and explained
#  in QUT's Manual of Policies and Procedures, Section C/5.3
#  "Academic Integrity" and Section E/2.1 "Student Code of Conduct".
#
#  Put your student number here as an integer and your name as a
#  character string:
#
student_number = None
student_name   = None
#
#  NB: Files submitted without a completed copy of this statement
#  will not be marked.  All files submitted will be subjected to
#  software plagiarism analysis using the MoSS system
#  (http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/).

#-----Assessment Task 2 Description----------------------------------#
#
#  In this assessment task you will combine your knowledge of Python
#  programming, HTML-style mark-up languages, pattern matching,
#  database management, and Graphical User Interface design to produce
#  a robust, interactive "app" that allows its user to view and save
#  data from multiple online sources.
#
#  See the client's briefings accompanying this file for full
#  details.
#
#  Note that this assessable assignment is in multiple parts,
#  simulating incremental release of instructions by a paying
#  "client".  This single template file will be used for all parts,
#  together with some non-Python support files.
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------#



#-----Set up---------------------------------------------------------#
#
# This section imports standard Python 3 modules sufficient to
# complete this assignment.  Don't change any of the code in this
# section, but you are free to import other Python 3 modules
# to support your solution, provided they are standard ones that
# are already supplied by default as part of a normal Python/IDLE
# installation.
#
# However, you may NOT use any Python modules that need to be
# downloaded and installed separately, such as "Beautiful Soup" or
# "Pillow", because the markers will not have access to such modules
# and will not be able to run your code.  Only modules that are part
# of a standard Python 3 installation may be used.

# A function for exiting the program immediately (renamed
# because "exit" is already a standard Python function).
from sys import exit as abort

# A function for opening a web document given its URL.
# [You WILL need to use this function in your solution,
# either directly or via the "download" function below.]
from urllib.request import urlopen

# Some standard Tkinter functions.  [You WILL need to use
# SOME of these functions in your solution.]  You may also
# import other widgets from the "tkinter" module, provided they
# are standard ones and don't need to be downloaded and installed
# separately.  (NB: Although you can import individual widgets
# from the "tkinter.tkk" module, DON'T import ALL of them
# using a "*" wildcard because the "tkinter.tkk" module
# includes alternative versions of standard widgets
# like "Label" which leads to confusion.  If you want to use
# a widget from the tkinter.ttk module name it explicitly,
# as is done below for the progress bar widget.)
from tkinter import *
from tkinter.scrolledtext import ScrolledText
from tkinter.ttk import Progressbar

# Functions for finding occurrences of a pattern defined
# via a regular expression.  [You do not necessarily need to
# use these functions in your solution, because the problem
# may be solvable with the string "find" function, but it will
# be difficult to produce a concise and robust solution
# without using regular expressions.]
from re import *

# A function for displaying a web document in the host
# operating system's default web browser (renamed to
# distinguish it from the built-in "open" function for
# opening local files).  [You WILL need to use this function
# in your solution.]
from webbrowser import open as urldisplay

# All the standard SQLite database functions.  [You WILL need
# to use some of these in your solution.]
from sqlite3 import *

#

#-----Validity Check-------------------------------------------------#
#
# This section confirms that the student has declared their
# authorship.  You must NOT change any of the code below.
#

if not isinstance(student_number, int):
    print('\nUnable to run: No student number supplied',
          '(must be an integer)\n')
    abort()
if not isinstance(student_name, str):
    print('\nUnable to run: No student name supplied',
          '(must be a character string)\n')
    abort()

#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------#



#-----Supplied Function----------------------------------------------#
#
# Below is a function you can use in your solution if you find it
# helpful.  You are not required to use this function, but it may
# save you some effort.  Feel free to modify the function or copy
# parts of it into your own code.
#

# A function to download and save a web document.  The function
# returns the downloaded document as a character string and
# optionally saves it as a local file.  If the attempted download
# fails, an error message is written to the shell window and the
# special value None is returned.  However, the root cause of the
# problem is not always easy to diagnose, depending on the quality
# of the response returned by the web server, so the error
# messages generated by the function below are indicative only.
#
# Parameters:
# * url - The address of the web page you want to download.
# * target_filename - Name of the file to be saved (if any).
# * filename_extension - Extension for the target file, usually
#      "html" for an HTML document or "xhtml" for an XML
#      document.
# * save_file - A file is saved only if this is True. WARNING:
#      The function will silently overwrite the target file
#      if it already exists!
# * char_set - The character set used by the web page, which is
#      usually Unicode UTF-8, although some web pages use other
#      character sets.
# * incognito - If this parameter is True the Python program will
#      try to hide its identity from the web server. This can
#      sometimes be used to prevent the server from blocking access
#      to Python programs. However we discourage using this
#      option as it is both unreliable and unethical to
#      override the wishes of the web document provider!
