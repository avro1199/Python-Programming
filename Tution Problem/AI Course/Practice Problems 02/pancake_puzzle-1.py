"""

Complete the function marked with "INSERT YOUR CODE HERE"

If you don't know where to start, have a good look at the 
implementation of the sliding puzzle  (file sliding_puzzle.py)

- Define an heuristic for this problem (see hint in lecture slide).
- Compare the performance A* and BFS on this problem.
